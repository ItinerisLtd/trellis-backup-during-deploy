deploy_initialize_after:
  - "{{ playbook_dir }}/vendor/roles/trellis-backup-during-deploy/tasks/main.yml"
```

## Usage

[Deploy](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/deploys/#example) as usual. No special action needed.

[`$ wp db export`](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/db/export/) is invoked during deploy. You can find the database dump in `/srv/www/example.com/releases/2018XXXXXXXXXX/example_com_env-2018-XX-XX-XXXXXXX.sql` â€“ be sure to check the pre-latest `release`-folder (e.g. the release before deploy) since `current` serves as alias to the latest release.
